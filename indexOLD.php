            	Greetings!<br>
				Welcome to my space on the web. Have fun exploring my artwork, submitting for a commission or 
                purchasing an image. If you have something in mind, and would like to see your idea come to 
                life, I can help. Please contact me if you have any questions or need assistance in giving 
                your vision life!
			</p>
