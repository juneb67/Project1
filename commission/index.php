                <p>
                    My name is Victoria Bowman. I'm a 20-year-old student attending the Hite Art College at 
                    the University of Louisville. I'm working toward a BA, with a focus on graphic design.
             	</p>
                <p> 
                    My illustrations focus on the strange - I like things that are weird but still retain 
                    an interesting quality to them. I focus a lot on line, mark making, and lighting. I like 
                    drawings with faster movement and fun colors. 
              	</p>
                <p>
                	The majority of my work expresses this 
                    preference. Comic books and graphic novels are largely an inspiration to me as well as 
                    digital illustrations.

                    I am open for personalized print commissioned work. I operate through PayPal or Chase QuickPay.

Due to my own personal constraints, the largest I can mail is 24'' x 36” as a poster. 
You also have the option to print it yourself- I will email you the file and you can print it in your preferred method.
</p>

<p>
I will draw about anything you can think of. Any idea you've wanted done, I am up for the challenge!
I will not, however, draw the following:
</p>

<ul class="disk">
	<li>Extreme sexual/gory situations</li>
	<li>Furries</li>
	<li>Pedophilia</li>
	<li>Drug Usage</li>
	<li>Copyrighted Material</li>
</ul>

<p>
I also run a web-comic series called <a href="http://tapastic.com/series/Paperback-Trade" target="_blank">Paperback Trade on Tapastic</a>- it&#146;s a Slice of Life Comedy about how I deal with situations that fall into or on me. You can support me further there by subscribing!
