# Project1
Project for Code Louisville. This project is an online portfolio for a local artist - Tori Bowman
I used php, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Foundation to create the fiished project. It has a customized video player, several modal windows featuring artwork and a purchase page with Buy It Now buttons from PayPal. On the contact page there is a form that submits and sends an email.
