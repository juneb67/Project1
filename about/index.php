				My name is Victoria Bowman. I'm a 20-year-old student attending the Hite Art College at 
                the University of Louisville.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm working toward a BA, with a focus on graphic design. My illustrations focus on the 
                strange - I like things that are weird but still retain an interesting quality to them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I focus a lot on line, mark making, and lighting. I like drawings with faster movement 
                and fun colors. The majority of my work expresses this preference. Comic books and graphic 
                novels are largely an inspiration to me as well as digital illustrations.
